## Setting up a new Raspberry Pi as a Randomatone ##

- set up the RPi with wifi and enable ssh access in the configuration
- scp serverless/setup.sh onto the machine
- decide on an IP number for the machine (eg 192.168.1.19) and configure the scipt (ie ipn=19)
- run setup.sh on the RPi
- copy the static.json setup file from google.
- restart the machine
